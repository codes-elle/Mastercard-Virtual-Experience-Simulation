### **README: Phishing Attack Simulation for MasterCard**

---

**Objective:**
This simulation is designed to help MasterCard employees identify phishing emails by comparing two seemingly identical emails. One email is safe, while the other contains a subtle phishing indicator. Participants are expected to spot the phishing signs and reinforce their email security awareness.

**Instructions:**

1. **Scenario Overview:**
   - You will receive two emails from "support@yourbank.com" asking you to reset your password due to suspicious activity.
   - One email is genuine, and the other is a phishing attempt. Your task is to identify the phishing email.

2. **What to Look For:**
   - **Urgency:** Phishing emails often try to create a sense of urgency (e.g., “your account will be locked”).
   - **Grammar Mistakes:** Phishing emails can contain subtle grammatical or spelling errors.
   - **Suspicious Requests:** Be wary of any emails asking for login credentials or personal information.
   - **Look Closely:** The phishing email may look nearly identical to a legitimate one. Pay attention to details like the wording, sender information, or minor text errors.

3. **How to Proceed:**
   - Review both emails carefully.
   - Identify which one contains the phishing mistake.
   - After identifying the phishing email, document your reasoning. Highlight the specific mistake that gave it away.

**Phishing Indicators to Watch For:**

- **You’re vs. Your:** Phishing emails often contain minor grammatical errors, such as using "you’re" instead of "your."
- **Email Formatting:** Phishing emails might have inconsistencies in font, layout, or tone compared to the official communications you’re used to seeing.
- **Unexpected Attachments:** Be cautious of any attachments or links that you weren’t expecting, even if they appear legitimate.

---

**What to Do If You Spot Phishing:**
- Do not click on any links in the suspicious email.
- Report the email immediately to the IT security team.
- If you’re unsure, it’s always better to verify by contacting the support team directly through official channels.

---

**Conclusion:**
Phishing emails are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but by following best practices and carefully examining each email, you can protect yourself and MasterCard from cyber threats. The goal of this simulation is to enhance your phishing awareness and your ability to recognize these subtle attacks.

Stay vigilant, and remember: **If you’re not sure, don’t click!**
